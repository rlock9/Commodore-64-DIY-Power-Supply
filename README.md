The Commodore 64 DIY Power Supply
Version 1: The Hybrid Build (For Local/Budget Builders)
This guide documents a working DIY replacement power supply for the Commodore 64. This version uses a hybrid approach, combining a modern, safe, PCB-mountable 5V DC power module with a standard, non-PCB-mountable 9V AC transformer. This build is a reliable and safe alternative to the original "brick of death" power supplies and uses parts that are available from local suppliers.

Warning: This project involves working with mains voltage (220V AC). If you are not experienced with electronics and soldering, it is highly recommended that you purchase a professionally-built replacement power supply. Proceed with extreme caution.

üîå Parts List
This list includes all the components you sourced for this build.

5V DC Power Module: Mornsun LD15-23B05R2-M (or equivalent, 5V DC, at least 3A, with OVP and OLP).

9V AC Transformer: Transformer 1A 9V AC (9VA, Input: 220V AC).

Enclosure: 1591SBK ABS Box (110mm x 82mm x 40mm).

Mains Inlet: BDD IEC C14M SNAP-IN.

Mains Cable: Standard "kettle cord" with a C13 plug.

Fuses:

One 3A, 6x32mm Fast-Blow Fuse (for the 5V line).

One 2A, 6x32mm Fast-Blow Fuse (for the 9V AC line).

Fuse Holders: Two PCB-mount fuse holders (6x32mm).

Protoboard: Double-sided PCB protoboard.

Wire: High-quality, insulated wire (1.5mm¬≤).

DIN Plug: Salvaged 7-pin DIN 45329 male plug and cable from the original power supply.

Cable Gland: CGP-PG11-04-BK (for strain relief).

üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Guide
This section should be a summary of the steps we followed. You can use your photos to illustrate each step.

Prepare the Protoboard: Cut the protoboard to fit the enclosure.

Salvage the DIN Cable: Carefully cut the DIN cable from the original PSU. Use a multimeter to map the pinout:

Pin 1: Brown wire (+5V DC)

Pin 2: Yellow wire (9V AC)

Pin 3: White wire (9V AC)

Pin 4: Green wire (Ground)

Mount Components: Solder the 5V DC power module and fuse holders to the protoboard. Securely mount the 9V AC transformer to the inside of the enclosure.

Wiring: Follow the wiring plan we developed, including the correct neutral, live, and ground connections for each component.

Test: Before using, test the power supply with a multimeter to confirm a stable 5V DC and 9V AC output.
